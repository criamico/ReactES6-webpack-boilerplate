# ReactES6-webpack-boilerplate

Boilerplate for a React ES6 project compiled in webpack. Features
- ES6 React transpiled via Babel
- Sass module enabled
- ES6/JSx linters enabled
- Live reloading with webpack-dev-server in Dev mode
- Webpack Production configuration generates index.hmtl, bundle.js and main.css already minified, deploys assets in /dist folder

## Folder structure


## Installation and use
Grab the npm version specified in .nvmrc:
`nvm use`

Install npm dependencies:
`npm install`

To run in dev mode:
`npm run dev`

This enables the server to run on http://localhost:8080/. When a file changes the server automatically reloads the page on the browser.
Since in dev mode ESLint is enabled, warnings are printed on the console but errors stop the compilation.

To generate the production build:
`npm build`
bundle.js and main.css are minified and deployed in /prod folder
